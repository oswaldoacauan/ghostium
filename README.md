# Ghostium

This is a fork from [original ghostium](https://github.com/oswaldoacauan/ghostium)
that is ready to be used on `Ghost 1.18.0`.

**Here are the changes I've made:**

1. Replaced `{{pageUrl}}` with `{{page_url}}`
2. Replaced `{{author.image}}` with `{{author.profile_image}}`
3. Replaced `{{@blog.cover}}` with `{{@blog.cover_image}}`
4. Replaced `{{id}}` with `{{comment_id}}` in `Disqus embeds`

*Note that by replace I mean replace in every project file*
